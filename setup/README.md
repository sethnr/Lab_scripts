# Setup

This folder contains basic instructions on which things you'll need to setup for day to day coding in the lab. 
Signing up for all the accounts (git/hpc/etc) are essential, and R is probably going to be crucial too. 
Python, docker and the HPC cluster will depend what projects you work on.

Once signed up for git/trello/etc please send me (seth) usernames so I can add you to things you need.
